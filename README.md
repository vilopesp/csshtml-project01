# UI & CSS PROJECT 
## Personal project developed to practice my CSS and Interface Design.

### THE UI :art: 
For this project, I wanted a minimalist but modern design with a technological vibe. I couldn't reach the initial result I had in mind, but I really liked the result I got at the end.

### THE CODE :computer:
In CSS, I tried to do something that used some properties other than the defaults and simple elements that I'm used to, like the position for positioning the yellow lines, the nth-child to be able to manipulate the logo colors according to light or dark mode, and I also created a dark mode option on the project, changed by a personalized toggle button.
